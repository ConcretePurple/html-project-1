    <h2 style="color:blue;">About me</h2>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">My name is Bindiya Bhandari, and I am passionate about technology and innovation. 
Currently pursuing the T-course at Studienkolleg Paderborn. 
I have knowledge in machine learning and generative AI, 
which are transforming industries by automating tasks and generating new data. 
This expertise enhances my problem-solving skills and supports my academic growth. 
I also have strong communication skills, allowing me to collaborate effectively with others.
In my free time, I visit websites that stimulate my curiosity and help me develop new game strategies, 
further fueling my interest in problem-solving.</p>

    <h2>My favorite hobby</h2>
        <p title="basketball">Basketball has always been my favorite hobby. 
I was part of my school's basketball team during 11th and 12th grade, 
and I still make time to practice regularly. Every evening, I head to the park, 
where there's a basketball court, and many kids come to play. This gives me a great 
opportunity to brush up on my skills while enjoying the game. 
My favorite team is the Los Angeles Lakers, although I don't usually watch basketball matches.
Basketball not only helps me stay active and break a sweat, but it also refreshes my mind, 
allowing me to study better without feeling exhausted afterward.</p>
